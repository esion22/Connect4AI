# Connect4 AI ðŸŽ®

Hi!

I've developed this connect4 AI just for fun! ðŸ“€

## Implementation
I've used Python along with the *[ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)* library. I've done this in order to obtain significant results in terms of execution speed.

## Algorithms used

- ***[minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)***
- ***[alpha beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)***

##  Usage
In order to run the AI you need to have a Linux subsystem on your PC. Here are some useful websites for doing so:
- [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

You also need to have *[Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)* installed on your machine.

For the GUI to run you need to have installed the *[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)* library. You can install it on your system using the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Then you have to download all the files and run the following command in the directory in which you've saved your files:
```
python3 GUI.py
